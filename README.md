This app simulates three rolling dices and scores a certain number of points for different combinations.There are three dice that appear in the middle and there is a Roll button that is customized with an image in the lower right corner. When you click the button or tap it if you have a touchscreen, the dice will change. If you get a matching pair you score 50 points. If you get three of a kind, you'll score based on the combination, 100 for three ones, 200 for three twos, 300 for three threes, et cetera.The app will show the result of your roll and display the score you've earned so far.
